Oh no… 
The ring… 
I… 
I… spent all of my money on that ring...
the arrangements for the restaurant... 
the band...
everything was ready...
everything was in place... for this day and... 
I lost it. 
What am I going to do? 
Hell, it'll take me years to make enough money 
to buy another decent ring… 
Ugh... what in hell am I gonna do?...
