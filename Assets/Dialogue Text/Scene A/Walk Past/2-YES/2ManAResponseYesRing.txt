Oh thank you so much, now I can propose. 
You have assuaged my worst fears! 
You are a lifesaver. Whatever could I do to thank you?

Oh! I know, do you like the Rock'n'Roll Man'o'wars? 
(You do.) 
I have this ticket to their concert tomorrow night 
(you like concerts)
I'd like you to have it. Please take it,
as a token of my gratitude, please...
