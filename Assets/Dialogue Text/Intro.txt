Great, I’m late…
Same as always. I can never seem to get myself out of bed in the morning.
Then again what is there to look forward to anyway?
This city is dying. All of its culture being drained away,
replaced by corporations, fast food chains, and unfair treatment. 
I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that I’m stuck in the same loop, 
forced to be subjected to the same unfairness that has infected our city.
And it’s probably my fault. 
I’m afraid… I’m going to be rejected as a person every time I run into someone… 
Feels like there’s no place where I belong. 
All my hope to find something like that disappeared a long time ago.
It’s too hard to keep trying to find a place that doesn’t exist. 
But I’m also afraid that if I don’t get up in the morning
I’ll lose my job, I’ll be doomed to be homeless… 
helpless to protect myself against an unfair, selfish city that hates my very existence.
… No use thinking about this, I’m just making myself feel worse…
